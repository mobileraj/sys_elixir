Systems thinking is a framework to create mental models of complex structures. In systems thinking, nothing is isolated.  You cannot accurately model a system without considering the interactions of all the parts. A system is defined as a set of interdependent pieces which work together to achieve a common goal. Systems are based on the concepts of "stocks" and "flow." Stocks represent individual states in the system. Flow represent how those states influence each other.
