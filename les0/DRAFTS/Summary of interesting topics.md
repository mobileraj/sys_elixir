#### State Machines
State machines model event-driven state. State machines capture the logic of all the states, events, and transitions in a system. This makes finding undesirable transitions relatively easy. State machines also avoid the need to adopt a defensive approach to coding, where state flags must be checked to ensure that a requested action is valid.

New states and transitions can easily be added to an existing working state machine,
